<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a Regional Manager at LearnWell, a company that provides educational 
        services to students receiving medical or other out-of-school 
        care. Our main goal is to ensure students still have a connection to their 
        typical school environment during this time. My role is to
         ensure that the medical facilities and teachers receive all the support 
         and tools they need to thrive.
    </p>
    <p>When I am not working, I enjoy learning about the latest and greatest
        technologies, while also maintaining my 5/5 Philly sports fandom. I would also        
        include that I have learned to pick up golfing as a weekend getaway, but my 
        handicap would suggest little learning has occurred. Thankfully, my wife and 
        pets have been gracious enough to endure through my lack of development. At
        least to my face.
